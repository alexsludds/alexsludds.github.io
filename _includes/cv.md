I am a Ph.D. Student in **integrated photonics** at **MIT**, working with [Dirk Englund](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qp/). My research interests are large scale and high speed  silicon photonic systems with low energy consumption. In particular, I am focused on demonstrating these systems on applications such as deep learning computation and Ising machines.<br>

I received my Bachelors of Science and Masters of Engineering Degrees both from MIT in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Earlier projects I have been involved in proposed using balanced homodyne detection as a means of computing vector-vector dot products.

As deep neural network (DNN) models grow ever-larger, they can achieve higher accuracy and solve more complex problems. This trend has been enabled by an increase in available compute power; however, efforts to continue to scale electronic processors are impeded by the costs of communication, thermal management, power delivery and clocking. To improve scalability, we propose a digital optical neural network (DONN) with intralayer optical interconnects and reconfigurable input values. The path-length-independence of optical energy consumption enables information locality between a transmitter and a large number of arbitrarily arranged receivers, which allows greater flexibility in architecture design to circumvent scaling limitations. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate optical multicast in the classification of 500 MNIST images with a 3-layer, fully-connected network. We also analyze the energy consumption of the DONN and find that digital optical data transfer is beneficial over electronics when the spacing of computational units is on the order of >10μm.

Recent success in deep neural networks has generated strong interest in hardware accelerators to improve speed and energy consumption. This paper presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is scalable to large (N≳106) networks and can be operated at high (gigahertz) speeds and very low (subattojoule) energies per multiply and accumulate (MAC), using the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit and image classification reveal a “standard quantum limit” for optical neural networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as 50  zJ/MAC, suggests that performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The proposed accelerator can implement both fully connected and convolutional networks. We also present a scheme for backpropagation and training that can be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of ultralow-energy processors for deep learning.
