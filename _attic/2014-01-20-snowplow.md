title: Concluding Snowplow's Winter of Code
tags: [News]
---

[Snowplow Analytics][snowplow] is a London-based startup
providing an [open-source][snowplow-github] analytics platform and held
a remote [winternship][snowplow-wintern] program for university students.
[I was happily selected][snowplow-intro] and just finished my projects.
I built on Snowplow's core platform in Scala with
[Spray][spray] and [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis], and
developed 3 new modules using these libraries.
See [this document][listings] ([src][listings-src]) for a snapshot
of what I built, and the repos for current code at
[snowplow/kinesis-example-scala-consumer][consumer],
[snowplow/kinesis-example-scala-producer][producer], and
[snowplow/snowplow][snowplow/snowplow].
I also built [bamos/github-wiki-link-validator][validator]
to check for broken links on GitHub Wiki pages.
