[My new cv](http://bamos.github.io/cv) is available in HTML and PDF format
to give people viewing my CV a better experience,
and I've open-sourced the scripts and templates I'm using at
[bamos/cv][repo].

For a short overview of the workflow,
the main data for my CV is contained in [cv.yaml][cv],
which is used by [generate.py][gen] to produce Markdown and LaTeX
with the templates in [tmpl][tmpl].
The [Makefile][make] will call `generate.py` and
compile the LaTeX to PDF using [rubber][rubber],
and I upload the Markdown to my website using
`stage` and `push` inside of the Makefile.
