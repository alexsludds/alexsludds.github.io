I'm a student interested in open source technologies and today,
I am happy to join many others with a one-year GitHub streak.
This post summarizes my experiences and transitions I've made
over the past year.
My GitHub profile is [bamos](https://github.com/bamos).

# Takeaways
The following is a short list of my takeaways
that have largely been inspired by the rest of the blogosphere.

## Daily GitHub contributions are not a prerequisite to be influential.
Daily contributions are my preference and help me stay organized.
However, [git.io/top](http://git.io/top) shows that only 11 of the top 1,000
GitHub profiles have surpassed a year-long streak (December 15, 2014).

## Daily contributions don't distract from a personal life.
[Ryan Seys][ryan] challenged himself to make substantial code
improvements daily.
However, [Arn-O][arn-o] and [NatashaTheRobot][natasha] support and
provide tips for small GitHub contributions, including modifications to a
project's README and documentation and filing issues.

I favor counting small commits as part of streak to better
support external workloads and my personal life.
I have traveled to over 10 cities over the past year
with friends and family and am always able to find small
commits to improve my projects in less than 5 minutes.
These few minutes every day during sometime week-long vacations
are negligible and help me keep the streak for motivation during
my professional life.

## Writing, documentation, and issues can always be improved.
Hamming suggests in the Q and A portion of
[You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf)
that 50% of a project's time should be spent on the presentation.
To me, a project's README and other documentation are part of
the presentation.
I keep this 50% suggestion in mind for my projects,
though have never met it.

## Task management is key.
[Geoff][geoff] mentions that forgetting and missing a day is easy.
Many applications provide productivity and task management to help,
as summarized by [SocialCompare's table][sc].
My preference for the past year has been to use a recurring
'Github contribution' task.

## The community gives great feedback on well-scoped projects.
I've been happy for all of the constructive criticism and feedback
the community has given me.
These have helped me learn low-level details and big-picture scoping.
Well-scoping and describing projects helps avoid misunderstandings
and allows the feedback to be directed at the problem I intended
to solve.

## Keep 'open-source burnout' in mind.
I haven't experience this firsthand, but
[this open-source burnout thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8712035&utm_term=comment)
on Hacker News discusses reasons why people leave large
open source projects.

# Current Projects
The following is a snapshot of my top personal/weekend GitHub projects.

+ [latex-templates](https://github.com/bamos/latex-templates) and
[beamer-templates](https://github.com/bamos/beamer-snippets) provide
a HTML previews of LaTeX code snippets.
+ [cv](https://github.com/bamos/cv) is my resume/curriculum vitae system,
which produces Markdown and LaTeX from a YAML input file.
+ [dotfiles](https://github.com/bamos/dotfiles) contains
my Mac and Linux configuration files and uniquely generates screenshots.
+ [python-scripts](https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts) and
[shell-scripts](https://github.com/bamos/shell-scripts)
contain short utility scripts.

# Transitions over the past year

    <h2>Virginia Tech Graduation</h2>
    <p>
    I had great open-source research opportunities at Virginia Tech
    before graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science
    working with the
    <a href="http://www.magnum.io">Magnum Research Group</a>,
    the <a href="http://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/">Systems Software Research Group</a>,
    and on open-access mathematical software.
    Most of this work is still under submission and not yet available
    on GitHub.

    I was a summer research intern with
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/technology.html">Adobe Research</a>
    working on distributed systems.
    We released my work as an open-source project on GitHub at
    the beginning of August at
    <a href="https://github.com/adobe-research/spindle">adobe-research/spindle</a>,
    which this spike in my heatmap shows.

    I have happily started a Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University
    and am working on the <a href="http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/">Elijah</a>
    project and intend to continue releasing my work to the public as
    open source projects.
