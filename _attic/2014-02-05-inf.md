title: inf - shell convenience function for infinite loops
tags: [Bash]
---

When using my shell, I often want to loop a command
until I interactively want to stop,
such as calling [ps][ps] to check the status of a program,
looping a song with [mplayer][mplayer],
or to continuously check some other status.

[watch][watch] executes a program periodically, but has the
drawback of using the entire terminal and only showing
the result of one execution at a time.
The well known syntax for infinite looping in Bash and zsh is
as follows, which doesn't take control of the terminal and
periodically displays the output.

{% highlight bash %}
while true; do
  # Commands.
done
{% endhighlight %}

However, the infinite while loop has a drawback of taking
long to type, [even inline][inline-so] as `while true; do ./command; done`.
I just added the following `inf` function to [bamos/dotfiles][dotfiles]
and use it as a shorthand for the infinite while loop.

{% highlight bash %}
inf() {
  while true; do
    zsh -ci "source $HOME/.zshrc; $*;"
    [[ $? == 0 ]] || return
  done
}
{% endhighlight %}

I use [zsh][zsh], so change `zsh` to your shell, such as `bash`,
and change the `source` command to the initialize file you use,
such as `.bashrc`.
The final check to [$?][exit-ref] checks the exit code of the
shell and will terminate the loop if the program exits
abnormally, such as when the [interrupt signal][sigint] is sent with Ctrl+C.

`inf` allows for the following shorthand commands for looping.

{% highlight bash %}
$ inf 'echo inf-test; sleep 1'
$ inf 'mplayer tchaikovsky-marche-slave.mp3'
{% endhighlight %}
