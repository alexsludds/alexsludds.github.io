title: Using rtcwake as an alarm clock with Bash in Linux
tags: [Bash]
---

Recently, I've been using my computer as an alarm clock by using
a [rtcwake](http://linux.die.net/man/8/rtcwake) to put my computer
to sleep until a given time. I found and made slight revisions
to a script that wraps rtcwake to make the usage simplistic.

This script originated on a
[post](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=10878570&postcount=36) on
[Ubuntu Forums](http://ubuntuforums.org/) and was modified in a
[response](http://askubuntu.com/questions/61708/automatically-sleep-and-wake-up-at-specific-times)
on [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/). I won't repeat the information
given there. There is also another
[post](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11282241#post11282241) on
Ubuntu Forums that adds much more functionality to the script.

The modifications I made simplify both the code and its usage. If it's
executed without any parameters, the time defaults to 5:00 and if the
time is passed as a parameter, it sets the alarm for that time.
Nothing else needs to be thought about.
The most recent version of this script can be found at
[bamos/simple-shell-scripts](https://github.com/bamos/simple-shell-scripts/blob/master/alarm.sh).

# Usage
Executed at 6:51 AM on March 8th. First, wake up at the default time 5:00 AM
tomorrow, then at 7:00 AM today, and finally at 7:00 PM today.
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo alarm.sh
$ sudo alarm.sh 7:00
$ sudo alarm.sh 7:00 PM
{% endhighlight %}


# Script Overview
My changes are mostly in a new function to set the desired time. First,
use [date](http://linux.die.net/man/1/date) to get the seconds
since the epoch: [Unix time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
Then, compare this to the seconds of the time we want to set the alarm to
and set the desired time accordingly.
{% highlight bash %}
function set_desired {
    NOW=$(date +%s)
    DESIRED=$(date +%s -d "$*")
    if [ $DESIRED -lt $NOW ]; then
        DESIRED=$(date +%s -d "tomorrow $*")
    fi
}
{% endhighlight %}

Check the number of arguments and call `set_desired` with the
default or passed-in values. To set the default value to a time
other than 5:00 AM, change the value here.
{% highlight bash %}
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    set_desired 5:00
else
    set_desired $@
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly, kill all `rtcwake` processes (just in case) and call
`rtcwake` with the desired time.

{% highlight bash %}
killall rtcwake > /dev/null 2>&1
rtcwake -m mem -t $DESIRED
{% endhighlight %}

Anything executed after this
part in the script will be executed once the computer wakes up.
So, if I wanted to wake up to Tchaikovsky, I would
call [mplayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer).

{% highlight bash %}
mplayer ~/music/Tchaikovsky/MarcheSlave.mp3
{% endhighlight %}
